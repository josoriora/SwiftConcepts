 Concurrency vs Paralelism
 
 Concurrency is running things in serial order giving the appearance that they are being done at the same time.
 
 Paralelism is when you actually split up work in different units and they can run at the same time.
 
 There’s a famous computer scientist called Rob Pike, and I think he explained the difference between concurrency and parallelism beautifully. Here’s what he said:

 “Concurrency is about dealing with many things at once, parallelism is about doing many things at once. Concurrency is a way to structure things so you can maybe use parallelism to do a better job.”
